                <p>HOLY-MOTHER-OF-GOD-THAT-WAS-PISS-POOR-REFEREEING</p>

                <p>Expectation from Manchester United before the Real Madrid tie was to look competitive, but eventually be outclassed, which would allow them to focus on taking back domestic dominance from Manchester City by winning the Premiere league and F.A. Cup.</p>

                <p>But they blew everyone away.</p>

                <p>United were a Robin Van Persie finish away from winning in Madrid and a similar half-chance away from drawing level last night.</p>

                <p>They were dominant on the counter for 55 minutes (including an awesome own goal by the fuck up King Sergio Ramos)</p>

                <p>Then the referee went bonkers, sending Nani off for a high boot when: <br />
                1. He was clearly going for the ball</p>

                <p>2. THE BOOT WASN’T THAT HIGH!</p>

                <p>Mourinho obliged with subbing in Luka Modric who brought electricity to the Real Madrid attack and capped it off with a stunning equaliser from distance.</p>

                <p>The referee, on the other hand, continued his absolute articulate-and-detailed agenda of never ever giving United a penalty when Danny Welbeck was being harassed in the box.</p>

                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, oblivious to all the crap happening around him was chilling out with his former friends and out of respect for Manchester United, was having a ridiculously bad game. </p>

                <p>He did inevitably score. Duh.</p>

                <p>The dude did not celebrate and was humble and awesome towards United fans all night.</p>

                <p><s>I Love him</s></p>

                <p>Respect</p>

                <p>Sergio Ramos obviously tried his best to help united win. This is the dude who missed the decisive penalty in the semi-final shootout last year, who’s had a gazzilion sending-offs this season and was fouling Danny Welbeck whenever he got in the Real box.</p>

                <p>Magic moments:</p>

                <p>1. Welbeck’s a monster</p>

                <p>Raphael Varane might be the best thing to happen to the world since playboy, but Welbeck tore him apart for a 2<sup>nd</sup> straight meeting with his direct running and crazy ass pace.</p>

                <p>2. Fergie and Mou forever</p>

                <p>After Nani had been sent off, Mourinho went over to a fuming Sir Alex and said something along the lines of, “That referee is a crazy bitch”. </p>

                <p>This is the kind of ass kissing you have to do if you want to be United’s next manager.</p>

                <p>3. Giggy was ELECTRIC</p>

                <p>Old boy Ryan Giggs in his monumental 1000<sup>th</sup> appearance for Manchester united put in one hell of a shift protecting Rafael and united from the wrath of CR7.</p>

                <p>The best moment being when he got the crowd going by asking them to be louder when <s>Nani was sent off </s>referee made some mind numbing decisions.</p>

                <p>4. Robin Van Persie chilling on the ground</p>

                <p>RVP was seen flat ass on the field innumerable times, passer-by’s reported that he was mulling over why wasn’t the Real Madrid keeper moving aside to let him score.</p>

                <p>5. Ronaldo Return</p>

                <p>Moment of the match for me, CR7 gets the ball about 30 yards from goal, a step over here…a shimmy there and he’s one on one with Rio Ferdinand in the box, shoots straight at De Gea and looks up at the familiar Manchester skies.</p>
